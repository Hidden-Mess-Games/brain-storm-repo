MAX'S IDEAS

Eldritch Horror Powergame
- Demons or some form of evil have taken over earth
- You come in afterwards, and are there to fight them
but not for good, for challenging world domination
- Sort of casual power game that can be more difficult
if you want it to be
- More so a puzzle game than anything with powers
like black holes, and other powers

Open World Survival Game (Dark souls story and quest system)
- Tight mechanics around shooting
- You don't neccesarily earn levels to increase power
- Enemies don't scale, but are still dangerous
- Weapons scale with type of weapon, but due to skills
- (Possible skyrim system where the more you do something the more you level it up?)

Themes/Settings (separate from game mechanics):
- Abandoned World Theme (Google: Abandoned Russian buildings for Reference)
	- Empty buildings, not necessarily destroyed just old and left to dust
    - Lots of nature/overgrowth
- The sun has changed, and weird events are occuring because of it
- A star being lands on Earth immediately after a WWIII type event to find it 
overrun by evil... little does the evil know that all its plans are about to be ruined

EVAN'S IDEAS

First Person Planet Siege
- Tight shooting mechanics
- Orbital Drop into alien planet
	- Similar to Quake 4 idea wise
- Humanity invading planet for purpose of self-defense
- You participate in different parts of a siege on a planets
- You fight with different groups, infantry, tank, air etc.

Underground Civilization
-Humans sent out colonists to estabisha  settlement
-Had to establish it underground
-There was another alient species there
-All out undergournd war is currently taking place
-Humans from another colony arrived at their distress beacon

Space RPG
- It's a space RPG

NICK'S IDEAS

Space Shooter
- Lots of potential variety in spaceships/atmospheres without lots of coding baggage on top
- Variety of ship sizes could allow for neat rock-paper-scissors interactions
- Prototyping would likely be easy, with simple blockouts for ships
- Simple objects could allow for Fashion-Souls style customization of ships

- Something along the lines of a round-based style game, similar to Overwatch or World of Tanks/Warships
- Easily expanded upon, but could have very few initial working parts for the whole game
- Seems like there would be a fairly even split of game-mechanics, network/engine mechanics, and art responsibilities

Subnautica but in space
- Start on an alien planet, something like minecraft mixed with factorio, build stuff to get off the planet and explore further out.
Build-Plan for something like this would be the following:
	- Create basic terrain mesh with simple shader in unreal to begin testing gravity/resource collection
	- One person (artist) create blockouts of resource objects and provide to level, other person (coder) creates mechanics behind how resource collection works
	- As more mechanics get added, artist can create blockouts for coder to use while iteratively creating new shaders and meshes
	Some starting mechanics ideas:
	- mine some rocks and get resources
	- moon = low gravity jumping, (special boots for normal jumping ?). Gravity in general could be played with
	- player has limited oxygen supply and has to recycle oxygen at base
	- larger oxygen tank so player can be outside base longer 
	- A moon rover car, low grav jumps would be fun
	- build a gun/knife or some other moon-future NASA weapon
	- day/night cycles
	- some sort of food/water farming mechanics
	- flight (jetpack?)
	- environmental hazards (moonquakes???)
	- Creatures? This should come later because it would likely require more in-depth art work

JOSH'S IDEAS 
- How about Pacman but with a battle pass and if you want to turn the ghosts blue so you can eat them you have to pay a $1.99 microtransaction. Also make Ms. Pacman and other cosmetics unlockable in super low odd loot-boxes filled with mostly shitty voice-lines and other garbage.
- PROFIT
