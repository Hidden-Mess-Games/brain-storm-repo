Idea for a space game (I keep thinking it would be on the moon, but doesn't have to be)

Player has a pre-made starter base with some bare necessities.
They can adventure out further and upgrade their tech to make living a bit easier.
There are 3 radio towers that have been damaged by seismic activity, and need repairs.
  These radio relays each link to an external base even further away from the players initial base, that are not easy to reach.
  
  The three external bases are these:
    1. Seismic activity base:
      Detects alien activity below the surface and gives the player a pre-warning of impending alien attacks
    2. Artillery base:
      Allows the player to call in artillery and kill enemies from afar
    3. Mechanic base:
      Allows the player to build more vehicles: walker, bike, tank, better auto-turrets, walls...
    
  After all three relays have been connected, the player receives an external message about a shuttle that crashed.
  The shuttle is in pieces around the main base, but can be reconstructed at the mechanic base.
  The main base can now use a radar to find the pieces of the shuttle.
  The mechanics base can build a vehicle to carry the shuttle piece, and repair them.
  
After each relay/base is opened, alien activity increases, and the game would get a bit more difficult.

After all bases have been opened up, alien activity would increase quite a bit, with more frequent attacks and bigger enemies.
  
The game could start the player in the main base, with some super easy tasks to get familiar with the surroundings.
  Fix the power: walk outside and switch from one battery to another.


Some mechanic ideas, kinda in "priority" order but it's loose:
  All the stuff above
  Day/night cycle (would look totally dope)
  Health
  Oxygen consumption
  Resource collection
  Tech upgrades
    Better oxygen tank
    Binoculars
    Mini-map display
  Lunar rover car
  Enemies
  Weapons
  Base-building
  Auto-turrets
  Hunger and thirst
  Food/water
  Jetpack for flying around
  Waypoint markers that can be placed (like a milemarker with a light on top)
  First/third-person camera toggle
  Extremely minimal UI, with info available via in-environment displays
  Landmines
  Smaller easter-eggs that the player can find from exploring the surrounding area
  
  
Some art style options:
  Super-minimal UI:
    Pretty much everything that the player needs to know could be represented within the environment.
    For example: the status of the three radio towers could be shown on a hologram display in the main base:
      They would all start "offline" or "disconnected" or something like that, as they are repaired the would change
    The player's arms could have indicators for oxygen and fuel
      There could also be pop-up wrist mechanics for a minimap or an artillery targeting reticle
    The rover could have a gas gauge
    A combo first/third-person camera could help with this because it would allow more real-estate on the player
  Day-night cycles could be really cool with stars and local lighting, it could also be used for alien aggression  
  Sound design would be fun. Atmosphere vs. no atmosphere. Would guns make noise? Would there be a breathing thing for the space suit?
  
  
High-Level Creation Process:
  -Create alien planet surface
    -Create material
    -Create landscape in unreal
      -Procedural noise for extra detail?
      -Statically created or procedural?
  -Create basic blockouts of large items   
    -Blockout main base
    -Blockout antennae
    -Blockout external bases
    -Add objects that represent player interactables so that other mechanics can be worked on at the same time
  -Create simple character controls
    -First/third person starter content would basically do this for us
    -Work on jumping/movement and other player controls
    -Could start on flying, i:e; jetpack mechanics
    
  -After player and planet surface are created, other mechanics can be added
  -Art can be iterated while mechanics are being made
    
  -Add Radio Relay connection mechanics
    -Relays need to be repaired somehow
    -Relay should connect back to main base and trigger some events that change something (can be super simple at start)
  -Add external base mechanics
    -External bases need to be repaired somehow
    -After they are repaired the player gets a new mechanic unlock
  
  -After main base/relay mechanics have been made, the core is basically finished, now for the fun stuff
    -Moon car, explore driving mechanics
    -Jetpack/flying polishing
    -Slow-mo bullet-time with 80's synth music???
      -I imagine a moon rover flying over a hill in low-gravity, 
        getting sick air while aliens are coming out of the ground and someone is firing a turret
        with auto-turrets to the side unloading at enemies
    -We could basically add whatever from here on out, cause the main game is mostly done
